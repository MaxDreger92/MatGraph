Do not aggregate the data in a single node each property needs to extracted separately so that a complete graph can be constructed. 
HINTS:
1. Each Attribute consists of:
    AttributeValue: Value of the attribute(can be extracted from the table cell or the header, or the context)
    AttributeReference: Either the ColumnIndex if extracted from the table cell or "header" or "guess" if the attribute was inferred from the header or the context.
2. Always assign the correct unit to each property node, if no unit is given you guess the correct unit.
3. The unit needs to match the property for this you can use the header content as well as your knowledge in materials science.
4. Attribute values should only be extracted as a list if they are part of the same property of the same material.

list should contain all distinguishable matter nodes and their attributes. Use every element of the list to generate the nodes you have to 
correctly decide which elements can be aggregated to nodes. 

Thought 1: Use the input data and the Context (table and domain) to generate a complete list of nodes.
Thought 2: The nodes will be used to construct a graph therefore it is important to extract all relevant nodes from the table.
Thought 3: Each node attribute consists of a value and an reference:
    -AttributeValue: extract from value or infer from the header or context"
    -AttributeReference:  -integer(ColumhnIndex) if extracted from the 'Value' key,
                          -"header" if extracted from the header,

Thought 4: The header of the tables can contain additional descriptions of materials that you should add to the name list. 
Thought 5. Never store components and its parts in one and the same node.
