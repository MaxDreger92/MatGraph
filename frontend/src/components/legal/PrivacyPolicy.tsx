                We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data
                protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the
                Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH. The use of the Internet pages of the
                Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH is possible without any indication of personal data;
                however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website,
                processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal
                data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally
                obtain consent from the data subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or
                telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data
                Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data
                protection regulations applicable to the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH. By means of
                this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general
                public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and
                process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection
                declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the controller, the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH has implemented numerous
                technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of
                personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data
                transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be
                guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to
                us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

                Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie
                ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character
                string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific
                Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites
                and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other
                Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be
                recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

                By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized
                with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our
                website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to
                utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter
                access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the
                website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another
                example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store
                remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a
                cookie.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our
                website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may
                thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may
                be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is
                possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the

                When using these general data and information, the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH

                viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (3)
                provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
                prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH
                analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of
                increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an

                valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the registration for the newsletters, we also store the IP address of the
                computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data
                subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the
                registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the
                (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it
                therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.
            </p>
            <p>
                The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only
                be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be
                informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter
                service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of
                modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical
                circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the
                newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be
                terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal
                data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked
                at any time or an alternative method of revocation is provided. For the purpose of
                revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also
                possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of
                the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.

                Due to legal requirements, the website of Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH contains
                information that enables rapid electronic contact with our company and direct
                communication with us, which also includes a general address for so-called
                electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the data controller by
                e-mail, telephone or using a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data
                subject is automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted voluntarily by a
                data subject to the data controller are stored in our CRM system for the purposes of
                processing, contacting the data subject and maintaining the relationship with
                interested parties. This personal data is not passed on to third parties. The legal
                basis for this processing is Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. Processing operations are based
                on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate
                interest of our company or of a third party, provided that the interests,
                fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail. We
                conscientiously protect your data against loss, misuse, unauthorised access,
                unauthorised disclosure, falsification or destruction. Within our company, your data
                is stored on password-protected servers to which only a limited group of persons has

                The Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH offers users the possibility to leave individual
                comments on individual blog contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the
                controller. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or
                more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts
                in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be commented by third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the
                comments made by the data subject are also stored and published, as well as
                information on the date of the commentary and on the user's (pseudonym) chosen by
                the data subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the Internet service
                provider (ISP) to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP address
                takes place for security reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights
                of third parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of
                these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so
                that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This collected personal data
                will not be passed to third parties, unless such a transfer is required by law or
                serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.

                We process your personal data on the basis of necessity for the implementation of
                pre-contractual measures in the sense of initiating an employment contract or
                amending an existing employment contract as a personnel development measure within
                the scope of your existing employment contract in accordance with Article 6 (1) lit.
                b GDPR. The processing may also be carried out electronically. This is the case, in
                particular, if an applicant submits corresponding application documents by e-mail or

                If applicable, the controller offers job interviews via video conference.&nbsp;
                Conducting job interviews by video conference replaces or completes the process of
                getting to know each other and personal communication between applicants and
                Forschungszentrum Jülich as part of the application process. These job interviews
                via live video conferencing are carried out exclusively on the basis of your consent
                in accordance with Article 6 (1) lit. a GDPR. We use video conferencing systems
                whose data protection-compliant and secure use has been checked in advance. If you
                nevertheless do not wish to use a contemplated system, you can reject this without
                disadvantage in the application process and request an alternative video
                conferencing system. Participants in the interviews will receive access to the video
                conference via an individual link. Apart from you, this exclusively concerns persons
                of Forschungszentrum whose participation is necessary for the execution of the
                interview. There is no permanent recording of job interviews or individual
                sequences, but only a (volatile) intermediate storage of the sound and image data
                stream, which is unavoidable for technical reasons.

                concluded with the applicant by the controller, the application documents shall be
                automatically erased two months after notification of the refusal decision, provided
                that no other legitimate interests of the controller are opposed to the erasure.
                Other legitimate interest in this relation is, e.g. a burden of proof in a procedure

                business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the

                16. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Matomo
            </h5>
            <br />
            <p>
                On this website, the controller has integrated the Matomo component. Matomo is an
                open-source software tool for web analysis. Web analysis is the collection,
                gathering and evaluation of data on the behavior of visitors from Internet sites. A
                web analysis tool collects, inter alia, data on the website from which a data
                subject came to a website (so-called referrer), which pages of the website were
                accessed or how often and for which period of time a sub-page was viewed. A web
                analysis is mainly used for the optimization of a website and the cost-benefit
                analysis of Internet advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                The software is operated on the server of the controller, the data
                protection-sensitive log files are stored exclusively on this server.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of the Matomo component is the analysis of the visitor flows on our
                website. The controller uses the obtained data and information, inter alia, to
                evaluate the use of this website in order to compile online reports, which show the
                activities on our Internet pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Matomo sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The
                definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, an
                analysis of the use of our website is enabled. With each call-up to one of the
                individual pages of this website, the Internet browser on the information technology
                system of the data subject is automatically through the Matomo component prompted to
                submit data for the purpose of online analysis to our server. During the course of
                this technical procedure, we obtain knowledge about personal information, such as
                the IP address of the data subject, which serves to understand the origin of
                visitors and clicks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the
                location from which access was made, and the frequency of visits to our website.
                With each visit of our Internet pages, these personal data, including the IP address
                of the Internet access used by the data subject, are transferred to our server.
                These personal data will be stored by us. We do not forward this personal data to
                third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our
                website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used
                and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the used
                Internet browser would also prevent Matomo from setting a cookie on the information
                technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Matomo
                may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of
                data relating to a use of this Internet site that are generated by Matomo as well as
                the processing of these data by Matomo and the chance to preclude any such. For
                this, the data subject must set an opt-out cookie. The opt-out cookie that is set
                for this purpose is placed on the information technology system used by the data
                subject. If the cookies are deleted on the system of the data subject, then the data
                subject must call-up the link again and set a new opt-out cookie.
            </p>
            <p>
                With each setting of the opt-out cookie, however, there is the possibility that the
                websites of the controller are no longer fully usable for the data subject.
            </p>

                18. Data protection provisions about the application and use of X (formerly Twitter)
            </h5>
            <br />
            <p>
                On this website, the controller has integrated components of X. X is a multilingual,
                publicly-accessible microblogging service on which users may publish and spread
                so-called ‘tweets,’ e.g. short messages, which are limited to 280 characters. These
                short messages are available for everyone, including those who are not logged on to
                X. The tweets are also displayed to so-called followers of the respective user.
                Followers are other X users who follow a user's tweets. Furthermore, X allows you to
                address a wide audience via hashtags, links or retweets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The operating company of X is X.Corp., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco,
                CA 94103, UNITED STATES.
            </p>
            <p>
                With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is
                operated by the controller and on which a X component (X button) was integrated, the
                Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is
                automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding X component of X.
                During the course of this technical procedure, X gains knowledge of what specific
                sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. The purpose of the
                integration of the X component is a retransmission of the contents of this website
                to allow our users to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our
                visitor numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the data subject is logged in at the same time on X, X detects with every call-up
                to our website by the data subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our
                Internet site which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data
                subject. This information is collected through the X component and associated with
                the respective X account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of
                the X buttons integrated on our website, then X assigns this information to the
                personal X user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
                X receives information via the X component that the data subject has visited our
                website, provided that the data subject is logged in on X at the time of the call-up
                to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the X
                component or not. If such a transmission of information to X is not desirable for
                the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their X
                account before a call-up to our website is made.

            <p>
                If the data subject is logged in at the same time on XING, XING detects with every

                on our Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the
                data subject. This information is collected through the XING component and
                associated with the respective XING account of the data subject. If the data subject
                clicks on the XING button integrated on our Internet site, e.g. the "Share"-button,
                then XING assigns this information to the personal XING user account of the data

                call to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the XING
                component or not. If such a transmission of information to XING is not desirable for

                site was visited by the data subject. This information is collected by YouTube and
                Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the data subject.

                YouTube and Google will receive information through the YouTube component that the
                data subject has visited our website, if the data subject at the time of the call to
                our website is logged in on YouTube; this occurs regardless of whether the person
                clicks on a YouTube video or not. If such a transmission of this information to
                YouTube and Google is not desirable for the data subject, the delivery may be
                prevented if the data subject logs off from their own YouTube account before a
                call-up to our website is made.

                Forschungszentrum Jülich is currently inviting our website users to participate in a
                survey. The aim is to identify improvement potential so that we can optimize our
                website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Forschungszentrum Jülich has commissioned the market research institute SKOPOS to
                conduct the survey and analyse the data. (www.skopos.de).
            </p>
            <p>
                SKOPOS GmbH &amp; Co. KG works in accordance with the EU General Data Protection
                Regulation (GDPR) and all other applicable data protection provisions as well as the
                regulations and quality standards of the market and social research associations in
                Germany. SKOPOS is a member of ADM (Arbeitskreis Deutscher Markt- und

            <p>
                Your data will be handled strictly confidentially, analysed anonymously, and not
                shared with third parties. In particular, the controller will receive only anonymous
                data, i.e. the information we receive will not contain your name, address, etc. No
                one will know what answers you personally have given.

                ResearchGate is a web-based social science-network that enables scientists to share
                their research results incl. research articels, experiment data, book chapters,

            <p>
                If the data subject is logged in at the same time on ResearchGate, ResearchGate
                detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire
                duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet
                page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the
                ResearchGate component and associated with the respective ResearchGate account of
                the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the ResearchGate buttons
                integrated on our website, then ResearchGate assigns this information to the
                personal ResearchGate user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
                LinkedIn receives information via the ResearchGate component that the data subject
                has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in at ResearchGate
                at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the
                person clicks on the ResearchGate button or not. If such a transmission of
                information to ResearchGate is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she
                may prevent this by logging off from their ResearchGate account before a call-up to
                our website is made.

                23. Legal basis for the processing
            </h5>
            <br />
            <p>
                Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which
                we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal
                data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is
                party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the
                supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article
                6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary
                for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
                concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by
                which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax
                obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the
                processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the
                data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a
                visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or
                other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other
                third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally,
                processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis
                is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned
                legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests
                are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
                subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are
                particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the
                European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if
                the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

            <br />
            <p>
                We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax
                regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the
                contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the
                data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by
                us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when
                our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data
                would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be
                concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject
                must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the
                provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for
                the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the
                personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
