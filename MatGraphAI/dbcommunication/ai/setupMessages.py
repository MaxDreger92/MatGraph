     Please follow these steps:
     1. Check for the best fit (which of the candidates is the closest to your input and a parent class of the input)
     2. Connect the input to the best fit
        2.1 If the class is a direct subclass of the input you can connect the input to the class directly (e.g. input AtomicLayerDeposition is a subclass of the candidate ChemicalVaporDeposition)
