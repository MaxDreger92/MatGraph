- Make sure the relationships are logical and adhere to materials science concepts.

Each property needs share exactly ONE 'has_property' edge with a matter node.
NEVER CONNECT one property with more than one manufacturing nodes.
If a property could fit to more than one matter node assign it to the one that its id is closest to!
